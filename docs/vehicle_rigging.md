---

You need a vehicle body and wheels named 'Wheel' parented to it. You can load them manually if the names don't match, or use the Load Vehicle Wheels operator. Once loaded, just press the Rig operator. The bones will be added to the object's origin.

Note: The vehicle body needs to be facing in the +X axis.
